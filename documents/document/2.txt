# Overview

**Welcome to Solidity Guides!**

This section will guide you through writing confidential smart contracts in Solidity using the FHEVM library. With Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE), your contracts can operate directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it onchain.

## Where to go next

If you’re new to the Zama Protocol, start with the [Litepaper](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/zama-protocol-litepaper) or the [Protocol Overview](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) to understand the foundations.

Otherwise:

🟨 Go to [**What is FHEVM**](https://docs.zama.org/protocol/solidity-guides/getting-started/overview) to learn about the core concepts and features.

🟨 Go to [**Quick Start Tutorial**](https://docs.zama.org/protocol/solidity-guides/getting-started/quick-start-tutorial) to build and test your first confidential smart contract.

🟨 Go to [**Smart Contract Guides**](https://docs.zama.org/protocol/solidity-guides/smart-contract/configure) for details on encrypted types, supported operations, inputs, ACL, and decryption flows.

🟨 Go to [**Development Guides**](https://docs.zama.org/protocol/solidity-guides/development-guide/hardhat) to set up your local environment with Hardhat or Foundry and deploy FHEVM contracts.

🟨 Go to [**Migration Guide**](https://docs.zama.org/protocol/solidity-guides/development-guide/migration) if you're upgrading from a previous version to v0.7.

# Set up Hardhat

In this section, you’ll learn how to set up a FHEVM Hardhat development environment using the **FHEVM Hardhat template** as a starting point for building and testing fully homomorphic encrypted smart contracts.

## Create a local Hardhat Project

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

#### Install a Node.js TLS version

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.

* Download and install the recommended LTS (Long-Term Support) version from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
* Use an **even-numbered** version (e.g., `v18.x`, `v20.x`)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Hardhat** does not support odd-numbered Node.js versions. If you’re using one (e.g., v21.x, v23.x), Hardhat will display a persistent warning message and may behave unexpectedly.
{% endhint %}

To verify your installation:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

#### Create a new GitHub repository from the FHEVM Hardhat template.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the [FHEVM Hardhat template](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template) repository.
2. Above the file list, click the green **Use this template** button.
3. Follow the instructions to create a new repository from the FHEVM Hardhat template.

{% hint style="info" %}
See Github doc: [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

#### Clone your newly created GitHub repository locally

Now that your GitHub repository has been created, you can clone it to your local machine:

```sh
cd <your-preferred-location>
git clone <url-to-your-new-repo>

# Navigate to the root of your new FHEVM Hardhat project
cd <your-new-repo-name>
```

Next, let’s install your local Hardhat development environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

#### Install your FHEVM Hardhat project dependencies

From the project root directory, run:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies defined in your `package.json`, setting up your local FHEVM Hardhat development environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

#### Set up the Hardhat configuration variables (optional)

If you do plan to deploy to the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet, you'll need to set up the following [Hardhat Configuration variables](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables).

`MNEMONIC`

A mnemonic is a 12-word seed phrase used to generate your Ethereum wallet keys.

1. Get one by creating a wallet with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or using any trusted mnemonic generator.
2. Set it up in your Hardhat project:

```sh
npx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC
```

`INFURA_API_KEY`

The INFURA project key allows you to connect to Ethereum testnets like Sepolia.

1. Obtain one by following the[ Infura + MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/services/get-started/infura/) setup guide.
2. Configure it in your project:

```sh
npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```

**Default Values**

If you skip this step, Hardhat will fall back to these defaults:

* `MNEMONIC` = "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
* `INFURA_API_KEY` = "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

{% hint style="warning" %}
These defaults are not suitable for real deployments.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}

#### Missing variable error:

If any of the requested Hardhat Configuration Variables is missing, you'll get an error message like this one:`Error HH1201: Cannot find a value for the configuration variable 'MNEMONIC'. Use 'npx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC' to set it or 'npx hardhat var setup' to list all the configuration variables used by this project.`
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Congratulations! You're all set to start building your confidential dApp.

## Optional settings

### Install VSCode extensions

If you're using Visual Studio Code, there are some extensions available to improve you your development experience:

* [Prettier - Code formatter by prettier.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) — ID:`esbenp.prettier-vscode`,
* [ESLint by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) — ID:`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`

Solidity support (pick one only):

* [Solidity by Juan Blanco](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) — ID:`juanblanco.solidity`
* [Solidity by Nomic Foundation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) — ID:`nomicfoundation.hardhat-solidity`

### Reset the Hardhat project

If you'd like to start from a clean slate, you can reset your FHEVM Hardhat project by removing all example code and generated files.

```sh
# Navigate to the root of your new FHEVM Hardhat project
cd <your-new-repo-name>
```

Then run:

```sh
rm -rf test/* src/* tasks/* deploy ./fhevmTemp ./artifacts ./cache ./coverage ./types ./coverage.json ./dist
```
